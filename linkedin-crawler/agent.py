Job Matching Criteria:
- Skill Matching:
  1. Perform a semantic matching of skills, allowing for related technology and skill equivalents
  2. Prioritize required skills over preferred skills
  3. Aim for a minimum 70% skill match
  4. Consider skill proximity and transferability (e.g., React matching with Next.js, AI agent matching with Gen AI)

Matching Process:
1. Analyze the job description's required and preferred skills
2. Compare these skills against the candidate's skills
3. Calculate a match percentage
4. Provide detailed reasoning for the match assessment

Output Format:
- Match Percentage: [0-100%]
- Reasoning: Detailed explanation of skill matches and gaps
- Skill Relevance Breakdown

Important Considerations:
- Be flexible in skill interpretation
- Highlight potential skill transferability
- Provide constructive feedback on skill gaps

At Weights & Biases, our mission is to build the best tools for AI developers. We founded our company on the insight that while there were excellent tools for developers to build better code, there were no similarly great tools to help ML practitioners build better models. Starting with our first experiment tracking product, we have since expanded our solution into a comprehensive AI developer platform for organizations focused on building their own deep learning models and generative AI applications.

Weights & Biases is a Series C company with $250M in funding and over 200 employees. We proudly serve over 1,000 customers and more than 30 foundation model builders including customers such as OpenAI, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Toyota.

Based in the San Francisco Bay Area. This role will be hybrid with occasional travel to meet with customers
3-5 years of relevant experience in similar roles, ideally working with enterprise clients or on large-scale machine learning projects.
Strong experience with Python and JavaScript, and a track record of success working with enterprise clients to solve technical challenges.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain complex technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Experience working in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure) and knowledge of Linux/Unix systems.
Expertise with Transformers, PyTorch, Numpy, and Pandas, alongside strong software development best practices.
Experience with new LLM/AI tools (Llamaindex, Copilot/Cursor, vector databases, Langchain, instructor, outlines, ...) and techniques.
Experience with version control systems like Git, automated testing, and CI/CD pipelines.
Demonstrated experience building AI apps in production
A strong drive to stay ahead of the curve with GenAI research and apply those insights to help enterprises build real-world applications.


Why This Role Is Unique

You‚Äôll be working directly with some of the most advanced enterprises, helping them adopt and scale GenAI in high-impact, real-world applications.
You‚Äôll be at the cutting edge of GenAI, working on projects that will shape how companies across industries use AI to solve their most critical problems.
